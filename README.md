# SceneChangeDetector
SceneChangeDetector is developed by using ASP.NET and python library [PySceneDetect](https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It is used to detect scene changes in videos, and automatically splitting the video into separate clips. The most common uses of it include splitting home videos or other source footage into individual scenes, processing and splitting surveillance camera footage and automated detection and removal of commercials from video sources.

The user will first upload their video to the system. Then it usually will take system a few minutes to seperate videos into different scenes. User will receive an email with their video link once the process is done.
